Changelog
=========

This is a full series of changelogs since I've been keeping records. The code for the prefixes is as follows:
+ + means addition
+ ~ means change
+ - means removal
+ = means a note
+ Double indicators means that it's a significant operation
+ ! as the first indicator means really important change
+ ~+ may be combined to indicate a modification that's tied to an addition, for example, fusing two tables into a new one
